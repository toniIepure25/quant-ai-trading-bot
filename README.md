## Overview

The goal of this project is to build an integrated trading system that leverages multiple data science and machine learning techniques to generate reliable trading signals. The system consists of:

- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:** Cleans and transforms raw historical financial data stored in a SQLite database. This includes normalization and extraction of technical indicators as well as latent features using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE).
- **Supervised Ensemble Models:** Trains several supervised models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, Neural Networks) and combines their outputs via a meta-learner optimized using hyperparameter tuning (Optuna).
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Implements a PPO-based agent that generates additional trading signals, complementing the supervised ensemble.
- **Signal Fusion & Portfolio Optimization:** Fuses signals from the ensemble and RL agent using weighted averaging, then computes optimal allocation inspired by the Kelly Criterion.
- **Backtesting & Paper Trading:** Includes a simulation module that mimics real-time order execution on historical data for performance evaluation.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Preprocessing:** Data cleaning, normalization, and transformation of raw financial data from SQLite.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extraction of technical indicators and latent features via VAE.
- **Ensemble Modeling:** Combines multiple supervised learning models to produce robust trading predictions.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** A PPO-based RL agent that provides complementary trading signals.
- **Signal Fusion:** Weighted averaging of ensemble and RL signals to derive a final trading signal.
- **Portfolio Optimization:** Calculation of optimal portfolio allocation using a Kelly Criterion–inspired approach.
- **Backtesting & Simulation:** A paper trading module that simulates order execution and logs performance metrics for evaluation.

## Architecture and Workflow

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**  
   - Historical financial data is stored in a SQLite database. Data is cleaned and transformed, with features engineered from raw OHLCV data and latent representations generated by a VAE.

2. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Technical indicators are computed, and latent features are extracted. These features are used to train individual supervised models.

3. **Supervised Ensemble:**  
   - Multiple models (XGBoost, LightGBM, Deep Neural Networks) are trained on the engineered features. Their outputs are combined using a meta-learner optimized with Optuna.

4. **Reinforcement Learning:**  
   - A PPO agent is trained to provide an additional trading signal based on market observations.

5. **Signal Fusion and Portfolio Optimization:**  
   - Trading signals from both the ensemble and the RL agent are fused via weighted averaging. The final signal is used to determine the optimal portfolio allocation using a Kelly Criterion–inspired formula.

6. **Backtesting and Simulation:**  
   - A paper trading simulation module tests the entire pipeline on historical data, providing detailed performance metrics and simulation results.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning:** TensorFlow/Keras, Stable Baselines3, XGBoost, LightGBM
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Database:** SQLite
- **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Optuna
- **Visualization & Logging:** Matplotlib, TensorBoard, Python Logging

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hybrid-automated-trading-system.git
   cd hybrid-automated-trading-system
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Database Configuration:**

   Ensure your SQLite database is located in the `data/processed/` directory and includes the required tables (e.g., `ohlcv_latent_features` and `ohlcv_features`) populated with historical data.

## Usage

### Training Supervised Ensemble Models

To train the supervised ensemble models and create the meta-learner:

```bash
python train_supervised_ensemble.py
```

### Training the RL Agent

To train the reinforcement learning agent using PPO:

```bash
python train_rl_agent.py
```

### Integrating the Trading System

To run the system integration module, which fuses signals and computes portfolio allocation:

```bash
python trading_system_integration.py
```

### Paper Trading Simulation

To simulate real-time paper trading on historical data and evaluate performance:

```bash
python paper_trading_simulation.py
```

## Backtesting and Simulation

The paper trading simulation module emulates real-time order execution based on historical market data. It:
- Iterates over historical data "ticks"
- Computes trading signals via the unified system
- Simulates trade execution and updates portfolio metrics
- Logs performance details for subsequent analysis

The simulation results are saved as CSV files for further evaluation.
